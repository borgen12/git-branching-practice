# git-branching-practice

this is a project to practice branching with git

Some Branching commands:
- "git branch' shows you the available branches and which one you're on
-" git branch branch-name" creats a branch called branch-name
-"git checkout branch-name" checks out the branch called branch-name
- "git push remote-name branch-name" pushes code from branch-name to the remote remote-name (usually origin)
